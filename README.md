# LcFormValidation tutorial

This is a simple tutorial of how to integrate the [`lc-form-validation`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lc-form-validation) form validation library in an existing React + Redux + TypeScript application.

There are two main folders:

## [00 Boilerplate](./00%20Boilerplate)
In this folder we'll have the basic configuration and plumbing all ready to start the integration. It shows a simple sign up form whith username, password and confirm password fields. The instructions of how to run this sample is in the README.md file.

## [01 Validation](./01%20Validation)
This folder contains the previous sample with applied form validations. Its README.md file contains a step by step guide you can follow of how the form validation was implemented.
