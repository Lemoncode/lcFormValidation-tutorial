# 00 Boilerplate

A simple sign up form without validations using React + Redux + TypeScript that has a sign up entity with _username_, _password_ and _confirm password_ properties.

This is only the boilerplate for a common scenario. In the next example we'll add the proper form validation using [lc-form-validation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lc-form-validation) library.

## Prerequisites
You will need [Node.js + npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your computer.

## Steps to run
- Clone the project.
- Open a command prompt and locate yourself in the _00 Boilerplate_ sample.
- Execute `npm install` command to install the dependencies.
- Execute `npm start` to run the example.
- Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in action.
